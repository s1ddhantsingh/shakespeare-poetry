Your ex-friend's sister met someone at a club, and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003, unbearable
Did you see the photos?
No, I didn't but thanks though
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make-believe it's Champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris
We were somewhere else
Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead
If you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown, I mean
The kind under where a tree has grown
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make-believe it's Champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris
We were somewhere else
I want to brainwash you into loving me forever
I want to transport you to somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth in swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights
Be the tower at midnight
In my mind
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway
Drinking Champagne
'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
