You said, "I know" when I said
"I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said "When can I, I, I come back?"
And you said
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

I said, "I know" when you said, "I did you wrong
"Made mistakes, and put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I come back?"
And I said
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
♪
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone, did you ever think of me?"
And I said
"That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"
(That's when, when I wake up in the morning) Yeah
(That's when, when it's sunny or storming)
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
(That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate)
That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
That's when I love you, that's when...
